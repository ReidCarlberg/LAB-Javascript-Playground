Welcome to Reid's Javascript Playground
=======================================

I've been playing with Javascript, so I thought I'd put everything together in a single org so it's convenient for you to try as well.

NOTE: this is for demo purposes, is offered as is without warranty.  Do not install into a production org.  (Seriously: go get a [free Dev Org](http://developer.force.com/join).)

[Install into a dev org from this unmanaged package.](https://login.salesforce.com/packaging/installPackage.apexp?p0=04tE0000000E8RF)

If you have an example you'd like to see (or contribute), go for it.
